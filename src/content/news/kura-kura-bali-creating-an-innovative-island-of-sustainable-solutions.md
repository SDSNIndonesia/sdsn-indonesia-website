The Sustainable Development Solutions Network [Southeast Asia Network (SDSN SEA)](https://networks.unsdsn.org/southeast-asia/ "Link: https://networks.unsdsn.org/southeast-asia/") co-hosted a conference dedicated to the topic of blended finance October 9-11, 2018. Held in Bali, Indonesia alongside the 2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Group, the second [**Tri Hita Karana Forum for Sustainable Development** ](http://www.thkforum.org/)hosted over 300 industry experts from around the region to brainstorm new approaches to financing sustainable development programs throughout Asia. The forum was also endorsed by the Indonesia Government. This was the premier blended finance conference in the world, putting Indonesia at the leading edge of this emerging industry of public-private partnerships. Prior to the conference, SDSN SEA led a day of celebration on the island of Kura Kura Bali.

Commitments resulting from the conference are listed below. This incredible, three-day event was facilitated by the vision and leadership of Cherie Nursalim, SDSN SEA Chair. Her unrelenting passion for sustainable development and ongoing commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is an example for others to follow. She is also responsible for all of the past and future planned activities on the island of Kura Kura Bali.

Kura Kura Bali–dubbed the “Island of Happiness” for its adoption of the ancient Balinese philosophy of _Tri Hita Karana_, or three routes to happiness–is making global headlines again for highlighting sustainable solutions. The spirit of Kura Kura Bali is to inspire a generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, and creative talents from all over the world. The vision of the island is to provide a space for testing inclusive new technologies and best practices for sustainable living by reducing energy use, conserving water, reducing waste, and lowering carbon emissions.

During the celebrations held before the conference, SDSN SEA, led by [United in Diversity](http://www.unitedindiversity.org/ "Link: http://www.unitedindiversity.org/"), featured two extraordinary announcements on the island.

First, the network cohosted a ceremonial dinner to celebrate the finalist in its [**Coastal Design Competition**](https://www.unsdsn.org/news/2017/10/25/island-of-happiness-coastal-design-competition/ "Link: /news/2017/10/25/island-of-happiness-coastal-design-competition/"), launched last year in partnership with HeroX. The competition called for innovative design concepts for a vertical seawall to increase the resilience of the island and protect its natural beauty. Seeking something beyond a standard concrete wall and aligned with the local ecology, participants were asked to create a prototype wall to protect the island that was also in harmony with nature. This was part of the famous [HeroX Prize](https://www.herox.com/), an offshoot of the X Prize, started by visionary Peter Diamandis.

The result was a remarkable story of co-creation, “crowd-sourcing” a truly global collaboration, and creating the world’s first prototype of an ecologically harmonious and environmentally sustainable seawall. Forty-two technically sophisticated seawall designs were submitted from around the world. The Coastal Design Competition is the first in a series of sustainability initiatives planned for the Kura Kura Bali Island of Happiness. The competition provides an extraordinary opportunity to challenge and inspire engineers, architects, entrepreneurs, and innovators from all around the world to develop sustainable infrastructure. “We congratulate the final teams for their relentless effort in delivering their best ideas and inspiration to develop new solutions while supporting the SDGs through the approach of _Tri Hita Kirana_,” said Cherie Nursalim.

On the same day, SDSN SEA co-hosted a signing ceremony with China’s [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html "Link: http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html"), committing to the development of a “creative campus” on the island as an extension campus of Tsinghua University in Indonesia– **Tsinghua SEA Center at Kura Kura Bali**. This partnership with the island’s creative campus is historical, as Tsinghua University is also one of the earliest Chinese institutions dedicated to higher education and research in sustainable development. Tsinghua SEA at Kura Kura Bali in Indonesia is one of only three of its global locations, tertiary to the United States and Italy. This partnership will further the vision to develop sustainable solutions on the island and to encouraging unique green solutions and prototypes to inspire the rest of the region and the world. Gede Ardhika, President Director of Kura Kura Bali said, “Tsinghua’s SEA Center, along with SDSN SEA, demonstrate our commitment to sustainability. This will be the hub for innovation and incubation of ‘technopreneurs,’ working in collaboration with various stakeholders.” The center will inspire the island’s co-creative learning process for humanity’s sustainable common future. The Tsinghua SEA Center will later serve as a key partner and learning lab for SDSN SEA. The global recognition of these two intuitions will be a strong foundation of their future programs and further collaboration throughout the SEA region.
